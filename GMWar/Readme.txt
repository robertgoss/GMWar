In GM War the object is to stop the soldiers starting at the top left of the screen
from getting to your castle in the bottom right of the screen. To do this you can
build different kinds of traps:
1. Wall - does no damage but soldiers have to climb over it.
2. Tall Wall - Higher than Wall.
3. Spike Pit - A pit doing normal damage to soldiers walkingover it.
4. Fire Pit - Does fire damage to soldiers walking over it.
5. Gas Pit - Does poison damage to soldiers walking though it.
6. Tar Pit - Slows down all soldiers moving though it.
7. Turret - Does normal damage to soldiers.
8. Flamming Turret - Does fire damage to soldiers.
9. Freezing Turret - Freezes soldiers in place.
10. Vemon Turret - Does poison damage to soldiers.
11. Large Turret - Fires slower than turret, but does more normal damage.
12. Hover Turret - Airboune turret, does more damage against flying soldiers.
13. Flamming Hover Turret - Airboune flamming turret, does more damage against
flying soldiers.
14. Freezing Hover Turret - Airboune freezing turret.
15. Vemon Hover Turret - Airboune Vemon turret, does more damage against flying 
soldiers.
16. House of Flying Badgers - A house doing normal damge to all who pass though. 
Can be climbed.
17. Burning House - A house doing fire damge to all who pass though. 
Can be climbed.
18. Gas House - A house doing poison damge to all who pass though. 
Can be climbed.

Each trap costs money to build. The price of a trap is displayed on its button.
To build a trap click on its icon between the two floors, then click where on 
either floor where you want it. To scroll though the traps click on the arrows.
The traps are the same order as above, Going to the left. You will get no more 
money, but you can remove a trap getting all of its cost back. To remove a trap 
click on the remove trap icon at the end of the traps, and click on the trap to 
remove. You can pause the game by pressing 'P'. While the game is paused you may
build/remove traps.

YOur money is displayed at the top left corner of the screen.
Your health is displayed at the top right corner of the screen. Each soldier which
reaches your castle takes away 5 health form you.

Soldiers can have different attributes on them. They all start off by flying in
and depending on their flying attribute, will fly a certain distance. Those with
higher climbing abilities, will climb faster. They can also gain fire, ice and
poison resistance. These attributes will change to counter the traps you build,
so if you build lots of gas pits, the soldiers will develop poison resistance.

Soldiers will continuely spawn in waves. SO survine as long as possible, and we
hope you have fun playing GM War.
